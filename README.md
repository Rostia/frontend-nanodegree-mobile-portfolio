## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.

### Getting started

#### Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to the top-level of your project directory to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ./ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

#### Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.

# List optimization
## Result link : [here](https://rostia.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio/index.html)
1) add ngrok.exe
2) minification images (./img/[all] , ./view/images/[all])
3) ./index.html: load print.css when need to print out
4) ./index.html: transferred JS files under body and add async
5) ./index.html: replaced the <link href="css/style.css" rel="stylesheet"> on the Internal CSS
6) [project-2048.html, project-mobile.html, project-webperf.html]: repeat of actions 3, 4, 5
7) ./view/css/bootstrap-grid.min.css: Add
8) ./views/pizza.html: replaced css/bootstrap-grid.css to css/bootstrap-grid.min.css
9) ./views/pizza.html: replaced the <link href="./view/css/style.css" rel="stylesheet"> on the Internal CSS
10) ./views/pizza.html: change images/pizzeria.jpg to images/pizzeria.webp
11) ./views/js/main.js: (function changePizzaSizes) moving variable declaration outside of cycle
12) ./views/js/main.js: (function updatePositions) items[i].style.left replaced by items[i].style.transform
13) ./views/js/main.js: ADD list random pizza async
14) ./views/js/main.js: remove querySelector* from cycle if it unnecessarily
